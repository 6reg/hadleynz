I’m the Chief Scientist at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com), and an Adjunct Professor of
Statistics at the [University of Auckland](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz). I’m from New Zealand, but I currently live in Houston TX with my partner and two dogs. I build tools (computational and cognitive) that make data science easier, faster, and more fun. 

## Books

If you'd like to learn more about what I do, and how to use R effectively, I'd recommend starting with one of my books:

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), with Garrett Grolemund,
  introduces the key tools for doing data science with R.
  
* [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis](http://amzn.com/0387981403?tag=ggplot2-20)
  shows you how to use ggplot2 to create graphics that help you understand your data.

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) helps you master R as a programming 
  language, teaching you what makes R tick.
  
* [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) teaches good software engineering
  practices for R, using packages for bundling, documenting, and testing your 
  code.

## R packages

Most of my work is in the form of R packages, of which I’ve written a ton. You can roughly divide my work into three categories: tools for data science, tools for data import, and software engineering tools.

### Data science

* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org) for visualising data.
* [dplyr](http://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for manipulating data.
* [tidyr](http://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for tidying data.
* [stringr](http://github.com/hadley/stringr) for working with strings.
* [lubridate](http://github.com/hadley/stringr) for working with data/times.

### Data import

* [xml2](http://github.com/hadley/xml2) for importing XML files.
* [readxl](http://github.com/hadley/readxl) for reading .xls and .xlsx files.
* [haven](http://github.com/hadley/haven) for SAS, SPSS, and Stata files.
* [httr](http://github.com/hadley/httr) for talking to web APIs.
* [rvest](http://github.com/hadley/rvest) for scraping websites.

### Software engineering

* [devtools](http://github.com/hadley/devtools) for general package development.
* [roxygen2](http://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) for in-line documentation.
* [testthat](http://github.com/hadley/testthat) for unit testing
